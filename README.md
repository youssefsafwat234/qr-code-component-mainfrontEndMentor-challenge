## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of semantic HTML structure and the importance of accessibility. I practiced using CSS Flexbox for layout and learned how to effectively use custom properties for consistent styling. I also improved my mobile-first workflow by starting with a responsive design and adjusting styles for larger screens.

**Example: Centering the QR code card with Flexbox**

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

This project helped me appreciate the value of clean, maintainable code and the impact of small design details on the overall user experience.
